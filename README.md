## Overview

**Image Steganography** is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to **hide secret text messages within images** using steganography techniques. With a simple interface and efficient encoding/decoding methods, users can protect sensitive data by embedding it invisibly inside image files.

### Why Image Steganography?

This project provides a hands-on example of combining image processing with information security. Key features include:

- 🖼️ **Encode & Decode Messages**: Seamlessly embed text into images and retrieve it when needed.
- 🔐 **Data Security**: Hide messages without changing the visible properties of the image.
- 🪄 **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter for a clean and intuitive interface.
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal dependencies, quick operation even on low-resource systems.
- 🧩 **Modular Codebase**: Easily extendable and readable Python scripts for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Package Manager**: pip

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnandAvinash9/image-steganography
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd image-steganography
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install manually:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow

## Usage

To run the GUI application:

```bash
python app.py
```

> Make sure all required files (like `steganography.py`, `app.py`, and any GUI assets) are in the correct directory.

---

## Testing

You can test the encoding and decoding functionalities via:

```bash
python -m unittest test_steganography.py
```

> Add `test_steganography.py` for unit tests if not already included.
